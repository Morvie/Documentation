  # Cloud provider and services
</div>

---

## What is the cloud?

The cloud is basically the internet. 
And it is a general term for anything that involves in delivering hosted services over the internet. Instead of just using the tradional hosting over one single server. But instead its gets hosted over a network of connected virtual and physical cloud servers. This ensures a more `scalable` and `flexible` hosting of website and applications. So, if one service gets overloaded or a server is down, the cloud will redirect the user to an another cloud server.

And can offer the option to host databases of SQL and NoSQL servers as well.

It can be seen as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS), in which software services can be integrated into with the software application. Such as:
- data storage
- data analysis
- monitoring and logging
- Container Orchestration
- Autoscaling
- Database solutions

But there is also Software-as-a-service `SaaS`, and Infrastructure-as-a-service: `IaaS`. For this project, I will look up the IaaS services and will consider the options within my project.

And will I use a public cloud over the private and hybrid cloud options. This is because I simply do not have the money to buy my own physical hardware for hosting the cloud myself. 

&nbsp;

***GDPR Sensitive!*** 

So, since I do not use a private hosting option. I do have to keep in mind, I can not control the physical server and have to rely on the provider. So, the  third-party could abuse usage over the cloud-services and get user sesitive data! Which can harm the GDPR rules over personal data that could be stored within the future in this application.

## Azure hosting and deployment

So I have chosen to host my application in Azure. The reason for this is due to the fact that Azure provides good documentation and support with .NET applications. This is beneficial because the microservices are primarily built with .NET framework.

So I have started out with creating a registry on the Azure environment and made a cluster for the needed services.
