  # Cloud provider and services

## What is the cloud?

The cloud is basically the internet. 
And it is a general term for anything that involves in delivering hosted services over the internet. 

It can be seen as a platform-as-a-service (PaaS), in which software services can be integrated into with the software application. Such as:
- data storage
- data analysis
- monitoring and logging
- Container Orchestration
- Autoscaling
- Database solutions

But there is also Software-as-a-service `SaaS`, and Infrastructure-as-a-service: `IaaS`. For this project, I will look up the IaaS services and will consider the options within my project.

And will I use a public cloud over the private and hybrid cloud options. This is because I simply do not have the money to buy my own physical hardware for hosting the cloud myself.

***GDPR Sensitive!*** 

So, I do not have more control over my data and can not oversee my third-party usage over the cloud-services! Which can harm the GDPR rules over personal data that could be stored within the future in this application.
